#### Group Work ####

# In his 1998 paper, "Women's Representation in National 
# Legislatures: Developed and Developing Countries," Richard 
# Matland seeks to describe the conditions influencing the 
# representation of women in national legislatures. With data 
# gathered from a sample of 40 countries, Matland ran an ordinary 
# least squares regression model to examine the statistical 
# significance of six commonly identified causal variables.

matland <- read.csv("matland.csv")
names(matland)

# Outcome variable:
# percent.women: the percentage of female legislators in the 
# national assembly in each country in 1995

# Independent Variables:
# system: an electoral system dummy variable (this equals 1 if a 
#         country has a proportional representation system, 0 if 
#         the system is majoritarian)
# right.vote: the percent of parliamentary seats held by right-wing 
#             parties
# women.ed: the percent of women with some college education
# women.work: women's labor force participation rate
# culture: a cultural factor score measuring women's standing 
#          within the country
# development: a measure of the level of development


# 1. Run a bivariate linear regression model that includes just 
#    one independent variable, women's labor force participation




# 2. Check the residuals. Is there a problem of non-constant variance?




# 3. Repeat 2 and 3 including right.vote, women.ed, culture, 
#    development, and system. Is there a problem of non-constant 
#    variance?
